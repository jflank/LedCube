# LedCube
Models an 8x8x8 LED cube using OpenGL on linux. Future versions will program the cube via the serial port as well.

There are some commands on the cube that are slowly growing. Right now you can change the rotation with the "uijkm," keys.

To see the 5x5x5 Z cube being solved, just make & run:
make
./LedCube -g -s

Search for "Great Z Cube Wooden Puzzle Brain Teaser" for info on what is being solved.
